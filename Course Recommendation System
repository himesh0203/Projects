Python Code: Course Recommendation System*

def recommend_course(percentage, goal, interests):
    # Normalize inputs
    goal = goal.lower()
    interests = [i.lower() for i in interests]

    # Define course options
    courses = {
        "engineering": ["Computer Science", "Mechanical", "Electrical", "Civil"],
        "medical": ["MBBS", "BDS", "Pharmacy", "Nursing"],
        "business": ["BBA", "Commerce", "Economics", "Finance"],
        "arts": ["Psychology", "History", "Literature", "Sociology"],
        "design": ["Graphic Design", "Fashion Design", "Interior Design"],
        "technology": ["AI & ML", "Data Science", "Cybersecurity", "Web Development"]
}

    # Recommendation logic
    if percentage>= 85:
        level = "Top-tier"
    elif percentage>= 70:
        level = "Mid-tier"
    else:
        level = "Foundation-level"

    # Match goal and interests
    matched_courses = []
    if goal in courses:
        for course in courses[goal]:
            for interest in interests:
                if interest in course.lower():
                    matched_courses.append(course)

    # Fallback if no match found
    if not matched_courses:
        matched_courses = courses.get(goal, ["General Studies"])

    # Output recommendation
    print(f"\n🎓 Based on your {percentage}% score and interest in {', '.join(interests)},")
    print(f"we recommend these {level} courses aligned with your goal of '{goal}':")
    for course in matched_courses:
        print(f"✅ {course}")

# Example usage
percentage = float(input("Enter your percentage: "))
goal = input("Enter your career goal (e.g., engineering, medical, business, arts, design, technology): ")
interests = input("Enter your subject interests (comma-separated): ").split(',')

recommend_course(percentage, goal, interests)
```

*🛠 How It Works:*
- You input your academic percentage, career goal, and subject interests.
- The script matches your interests with relevant courses under your goal.
- It also considers your percentage to suggest the appropriate level of course.
