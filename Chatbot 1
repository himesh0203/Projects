pip install chatterbot
pip install chatterbot_corpus


Chatbot Implementation:
Create a Python file (e.g., course_chatbot.py) and add the following code: 


from chatterbot import ChatBot
from chatterbot.trainers import ChatterBotCorpusTrainer
from chatterbot.trainers import ListTrainer

# Create a new chatbot instance
chatbot = ChatBot("CourseBot")

# Create a new trainer for the chatbot
trainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(chatbot)

# Train the chatbot with the English corpus data
trainer.train("chatterbot.corpus.english")

# You can also train the chatbot with custom course-specific data
# For example, a list of questions and answers related to your course
course_data = [
    "What are the prerequisites for this course?",
    "Basic Python knowledge and understanding of data structures.",
    "How can I submit my assignments?",
    "Assignments should be submitted through the online learning platform.",
    "What is the grading policy?",
    "Grading is based on assignments (40%), quizzes (30%), and a final project (30%).",
    "Where can I find the course syllabus?",
    "The course syllabus is available on the main course page.",
    "When are the office hours?",
    "Office hours are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2 PM to 4 PM.",
]

list_trainer = ListTrainer(chatbot)
list_trainer.train(course_data)

# Start the interactive chat
print("CourseBot: Hi! I am your course assistant. How can I help you today? (Type 'quit' to exit)")
while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "quit":
            break
        response = chatbot.get_response(user_input)
        print(f"CourseBot: {response}")
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, EOFError, SystemExit):
        break
