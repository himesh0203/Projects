Explanation for Online Compiler Compatibility:
speech_recognition library: Most online Python compilers do not pre-install this library or provide access to a microphone. You would need an environment where you can install SpeechRecognition (e.g., pip install SpeechRecognition) and have a working microphone.
sr.Microphone(): This component directly interacts with your computer's microphone, which is not accessible from an online compiler's sandboxed environment.
To run this code and actually use your voice on your local machine:
Install the library: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

PyAudio is often needed for SpeechRecognition to work with microphones.)
Run the script: Save the code as a .py file (e.g., voice_control.py) and run it from your terminal:
