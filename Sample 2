Here’s a simple *Python program* that suggests the best course for a student based on their *percentage*, *goal*, and *subject interest*.

✅ *Python Code: Course Recommendation System*

```python
def recommend_course(percentage, goal, interest):
    if percentage < 40:
        return "Focus on basic skill-building courses like communication, computer fundamentals, or vocational training."

    # High percentage
    if goal.lower() == "job":
        if interest.lower() in ["computer", "it", "programming"]:
            return "Recommended: BCA, BSc IT, or Diploma in Software Development."
        elif interest.lower() in ["electronics", "hardware"]:
            return "Recommended: Diploma in Electronics, BSc Electronics."
        elif interest.lower() in ["commerce", "business"]:
            return "Recommended: BBA, BCom with specialization in Digital Marketing or Finance."
        else:
            return "Recommended: Skill-based certifications (Data Entry, Tally, etc.)"
    
    elif goal.lower() == "higher studies":
        if interest.lower() in ["math", "physics", "computer"]:
            return "Recommended: B.Tech in CSE, IT, or Data Science."
        elif interest.lower() in ["biology", "chemistry"]:
